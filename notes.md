# Video notes

## 1. Installing RoR

Added a couple of extensions recommended by Chris
* Rails vscode extension (top hit if you search "rails")
* vscode-gemfile

I added both of these to devcontainer.json

## 2. How to create a new rails app

* Use `rails new .` to create the app in the current directory. App is named after current directory.
* My rails new command looked like: `rails new . --database=postgresql`.
